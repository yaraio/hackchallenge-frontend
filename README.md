## About
Tracklist is a music-themed iOS study app that gamifies task completion through a vinyl record progress ring. Every task you add becomes a track on the record — as you complete them, the ring fills. When all tasks are done, Side A is complete.

## Features
- Vinyl record progress ring showing overall completion percentage
- Expandable music player UI on each task with a real time countdown timer and scrubbable progress bar
- Record scratch haptic animation when timer runs out, with options to mark complete, add time, or edit
- Task creation and editing with time estimates in 30 minute increments and auto-calculated points


## Requirements
- **SwiftUI:** Built entirely in SwiftUI using stacks, navigation, sheets, and custom components
- **Navigation:** NavigationStack with NavigationLink between dashboard, task creation, and edit screens
- **@State / @Binding / @ObservedObject:** Task state managed via @State and @Binding flowing through all views, with TaskViewModel as an ObservableObject
- **Networking:** URLSession used in NetworkManager to communicate with backend — supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with JSON encoding/decoding
- **Data persistence:** Tasks and user data persisted on the backend and synced

## Notes
- The vinyl record, progress ring, music player UI, and record scratch animation are all custom built
- Haptic feedback is used throughout to enhance the music theme
- Backend repo linked above handles user accounts, task management, and the points/track system
